# 13. Turn the sentence into a list of UPPER CASE and also TITLED words.

# 15. Have variables fm, years = 106.5, 26. Then use concatenation to print "Faaji FM with frequency 106.5 is 26 years old today"
# Example Input: fm = 106.5, years = 26
# Expected Output: Faaji FM with frequency 106.5 is 26 years old today.
freq = 106.5
years = 26
print(f"Faaji FM with frequency {freq} is {years} years old today")

# 16. Create variables num1, num2 = 70, 80. Then print 70 * 80 = 5600 using CONCATENATION. And on the next line use INTERPOLATION to do it.
# Example Input: num1 = 70, num2 = 80
# Expected Output using Interpolation: 70 * 80 = 5600
# Expected Output using Concatenation: 70 * 80 = 5600

num1, num2 = 70, 80
result = num1 * num2
# Using concatenation
print(str(num1) + " * " + str(num2) + " = " + str(result))
